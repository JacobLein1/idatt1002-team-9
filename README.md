# IDATT1002 Team 9



## Project Description

System Development is a course that follows the Computer Engineering study program at NTNU (“Norwegian University of Science and Technology”). The System Development course includes lectures and a group project. The course gives the student relevant knowledge and tools they can use in System Development and project work. The group project is a part of the education method and it is what this report is based on. In the process of making a tool for handling groceries, we have spent time on documentation, discussions, planning, coding, group meetings, meeting with stakeholders, testing, etc. In this process we have learned why documentation is important and how to document when working on a project. Furthermore, we have learned how to set up a database, and we have gained more tools and knowledge for object oriented programming and team work.
